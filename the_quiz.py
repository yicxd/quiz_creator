"""
ok so in the question file each question is seperated by lines
so we could just print each line for each question
"""

"""
in the answer file the odd numbers are the choices
while the right answers are the even numbered lines
"""

"""
for randomization the program will pick a number and then print that line of question
for the answers its the number of the line question times 2 (for correct answer) minus 1 (the choices)

example

question    choices    answer
1           1          2
2           3          4
3           5          6
4           7          8
5           9          10
